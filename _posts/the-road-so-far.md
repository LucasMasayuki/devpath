The road of a developer can be a short or long journey, from intern to senior, from developer to CEO of a startup, the paths are multiple and start to track them can be from a confusing and distressing beginning.

Despite being relatively short (**3 years**) my walk through the world of software development, I want to share and archive all my steps that I took in the middle of the road, and the next steps I will take from now on.  And for that reason was born the blog devpath.

Come and follow my walk in case it's of any use what I'm going to write from that day forward.
